            I graduated from the University of California Riverside in June 2023
            with a B.S. degree in Computer Science and magna cum laude honors. I
            am currently working as a software engineer at Mission Support and
            Test Services, LLC. I am passionate about learning new technologies
            and understand there are multiple ways to accomplishing a task.
            Though I am most proficient in JavaScript, C#, and Angular, I am a
            fast learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed.

            I grew up in San Marino, CA, a small residential city in Los Angeles
            County. In high school, I played varsity tennis and ran cross
            country. In my free time, I like to read books and play video games
            and pickleball with friends.
